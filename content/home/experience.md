detecting and recording the user’s movements, i.e. hand gestures.
* Used SPI, I2C, UART for fetching the data to the microcontrollers and fused the gyroscope and accelerometer
data by compensation filter.
* Built a Bluetooth communication system with cyclic redundancy check (CRCs) to improve its consistency.
