## Abstract
To deal with the shoulder rehabilitation problem, we made an exoskeleton suit. 

In this project, there are two parts of the exoskeleton. The sensing part and the activation part, the sensing part would fetch the information about the rehabilitation exercise from the therapist.  

And then, it will send that information to the activating part to practice the action that recorded. 

Thus, the physical therapist can record his motion to the exoskeleton and let the patient do it many times.

Also, we made a GUI for the user to record and see whether their gesture is correct or not.
