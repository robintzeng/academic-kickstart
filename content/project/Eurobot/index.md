## Conteset
For each team, we have to make two robots that can cooperate to finish the tasks on the given map such as throwing the ball into a bucket and stacking the color bricks in the given order.<br>

When the robots finish the task, they would get some points. The team with higher scores wins.

I was the software team leader in this contest. In our team, we took charge of sensing the world and making the decision for the robot. In addition, I also made an indoor positioning system with UWB and Kalman filter which can locate the rival accurately.
